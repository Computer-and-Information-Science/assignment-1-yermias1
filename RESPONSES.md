## factorial2.cpp

- input/parameter impacting number of calls-
*The input parameter impacting the number of function calls in the factorial function is the value of n.
- 3 specific examples of input/parameter and number of calls-
*n=5, count=6; n=10, count=11; n=20, count=21
- number of recursive calls when input/parameter is *n*-
*The function on n is n+1

## ireverse2.cpp

- input/parameter impacting number of calls-
*The input parameter affecting the number of function calls in the ireverse function is n is true as long it is a nonzero number. 
- 3 specific examples of input/parameter and number of calls-
*n=123456, count=7; n=98765432, count=9; n=123, count=4
- number of recursive calls when input/parameter is *n*
For n>0, the number of recursive calls is the number of digits plus one; for n=0, there is only one call

## sreverse2.cpp

- input/parameter impacting number of calls-
*The input parameter affecting the number of calls in the sreverse function is the number of recursive calls is determined by the number of characters (the length) in the string.
- 3 specific examples of input/parameter and number of calls-
*str=12345678, count=8; str=876543, count=6; str=yonas, count=5
- number of recursive calls when input/parameter is *n*-
*If n>0: exactly n calls. If n=0: exactly 1 call.

## permute.cpp

- input/parameter impacting number of calls-
*The number of recursive calls is affected by the number of characters (n) in the string.
- 3 specific examples of input/parameter and number of calls-
*str=123, count=6(123,132,213,231,312,321); str=45, count=2(45,54) str=666, count=6(666-6 times)
- number of recursive calls when input/parameter is *n*-
*If n>0, the function makes more than n! recursive calls, growing rapidly as n increases; if n=0, it makes exactly 1 call.

## tower.cpp

- input/parameter impacting number of calls
- 3 specific examples of input/parameter and number of calls
- number of recursive calls when input/parameter is *n*

## fibonacci2.cpp (presented in video lesson)

- input/parameter impacting number of calls
- 3 specific examples of input/parameter and number of calls
- number of recursive calls when input/parameter is *n*
